System requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	
ProjectPier requires a PHP web server and MySQL. The recommended web 
server is Apache, but IIS 5 and above have been reported to work also.
	
ProjectPier is not PHP4 compatible.
	
Recommended configuration:
	
: PHP 5.1 or greater
: MySQL 4.1 or greater with InnoDB support (see notes below)
: Apache 2.0 or greater
        
If you do not have these installed on a server or your personal computer, 
you can visit the sites below to learn more about how to download and install
them.  They are all licensed under various compatible Open Source licenses.	
: PHP    : http://www.php.net/
: MySQL  : http://www.mysql.com/
: Apache : http://www.apache.org/

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
	
1. Make sure your server meets the requirements, see notes below regarding
   enabling InnoDB support.
2. Download ProjectPier from the project website - http://www.projectpier.org/.
3. Unpack and upload the files to your web server.
4. Direct your browser to the /public/install directory and follow the installation
   procedure.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Enabling InnoDB Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some installations of MySQL don't support InnoDB by default.  The ProjectPier installer 
will tell you if your server is not configured to support InnoDB. This is easy to fix: 

1. Open your MySQL options file, the file name is my.cnf (Linux) - usually at /etc/my.cnf 
   or my.ini (Windows) - usually at c:/windows/my.ini.  If you are using the Uniform Server
   on Windows, the file will be named 'my-small' and will need to be edited with a unix 
   compatible editor such as PSPad or EditPad Lite.
2. Comment the skip-innodb line by adding # in front of it (like #skip-innodb). 
3. It would also be good to increase max_allowed_packet to ensure that 
   you'll be able to upload files larger than 1MB. Just add this 
   line bellow #skip-innodb line: 
   set-variable = max_allowed_packet=64M

Alternatively, just install without InnoDB support. The installer will allow you.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Changing the Language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ProjectPier installation screens are in English and English is the default language
for the program. After installation is complete, the language can be changed.

The following base languages are available:
nl_nl = Dutch
en_us = English (US)
de_de = German
es_es = Spanish
fr_fr = French

Other languages packs may be available for download at the site.
